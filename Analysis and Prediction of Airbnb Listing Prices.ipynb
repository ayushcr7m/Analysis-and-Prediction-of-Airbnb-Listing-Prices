From this lightbulb moment, the founders managed to attract investment and expand their vision to a global empire with a 2020 private valuation of USD $26 billion. Travelers now have the option of staying at short-term vacation rentals or \"airbnbs\" in many parts of the world, creating a particularly efficient market for hosts who need their listings to be priced competitively. Major cosmopolitan cities like Seattle approaching nearly 10,000 listings will certainly create a demand for accurate price prediction and forecasting.\n\nThis analysis will highlight specific elements of the \"Seattle Airbnb Listing\" Dataset from 2018 which features 7,576 listings with 18 variables, scraped and maintained by Tom Slee, and available for download on Kaggle.\n\nIn this fun and hopefully insightful exploration, we will begin by examining the unrefined data and perform any necessary tidying of the dataset. We will then determine which features provide most insight into price prediction and remove those that only serve to add noise. Data visualization and exploratory data analysis will then be performed on the tidied dataset to inform our modeling.","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preparation and Required Packages:\n\nWe will begin by loading the following libraries: tidyverse, readr, data.table, caret, lubridate, glmnet, scales, stringr, dplyr, ggmap, ggcorrplot,\ntreemapify, rpart, nnet, formatR, rmarkdown, and knitr with the \"pacman\" package.

(All Models were tested on the test set though only the best performing Model (Random Forest) was selected for the final report).\n\n   In general, ensemble machine learning algorithms that aim to decrease variance were most successful (Bagging Tree and RF). Parallel ensemble methods like Random Forests have proven to be robust price prediction algorithms and therefore it comes as no surprise it was the top performer.\n   \n   \n\n# Conclusion:\n\n   If you have made it this far, then I really appreciate it and would like to wrap this all up with some concluding thoughts! Accurate price prediction and regression analysis continues to be a popular application of machine learning, though it is known to be riddled with challenges and seemingly endless input variables to contend with. This report presented visual and quantitative explorations that informed and augmented our predictive pricing models with some interesting results.\n\n   The visualizations, for example, those concerned with the number of guests, bedrooms, and bathrooms a listing accommodates, could inform Airbnb hosts of the potential changes they need to make in order to increase their cash flow. Additionally, the predictive pricing models can further delineate to what extent guests are willing to pay for specific listing configurations (e.g. location, number of bedrooms) with quantitative specificity.\n\n   The limitations of this report include the lack of feature engineering as certain variables could have been formed into new metrics to potentially increase predictive power. Furthermore, the presence of NAs without complete information available on the web to fill them with always leads to some semblance of inaccuracy. In terms of the modeling, the use of repeated cross-validation may have led to lower RMSEs as the dataset itself is not exceptionally large.\n    Future reports involving price prediction in the vacation-rental industry are likely to become more accurate with increasingly transparent data on sites like [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which feature detailed information about listings all over the globe. Additionally, recent advances in artificial neural networks as well as regression tree analysis promise to make price forecasting a more precise science.
